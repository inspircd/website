InspIRCd v3.4.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).

This release fixes many minor bugs and adds several minor features. Most notably:

- Added `<cloak:ignorecase>` to ignore the case of a FQDN when cloaking.
- Added a workaround for gateway IP addresses being banned by the connectban module.
- Added support for filtering part messages to the chanfilter module.
- Disabled DNS, DNSBL, and ident lookups for unregistered KiwiIRC.com users in the example provider configs.
- Fixed the example configs allowing voiced users to voice/devoice other users.
- Fixed the silence module not being able to add or remove entries in some cases.
- Updated the NetBSD `EV_SET` workaround now that upstream have fixed the issue.

No breaking configuration changes have been made since the v3.0.0 release but if you are upgrading from v2 please consult our [list of config changes in v3](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/breaking-changes).
