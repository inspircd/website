- Added `<joinflood:splitwait>` to allow disengaging channel mode `j` (joinflood) when a server splits from the network.

- Added `<shun:allowtags>` to allow configuring whether shunned users can send client-to-client tags.

- Added `<shun:cleanedcommands>` to allow configuring the commands that shunned users can run but that will be censored.

- Added support for the Argon2 key derivation function.

- Fixed disconnecting users who try to enable user mode `x` (cloak) when the md5 module is not loaded.

- Fixed xlines not being rechecked when a user's real hostname changes.
