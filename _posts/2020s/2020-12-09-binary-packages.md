Given the popularity of our existing CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu binary packages we are looking into shipping support for more platforms.

If you use a platform which supports binary packages that does not currently have an official InspIRCd package then please open an issue [here](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd-packages/issues).
