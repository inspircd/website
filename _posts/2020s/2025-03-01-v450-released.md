InspIRCd v4.5.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v4.5.0).

The most notable changes in this release are:

- Changed the `/CBAN`, `/ELINE`, `/GLINE`, `/KLINE`, `/QLINE`, `/RLINE`, and `/ZLINE` commands to make the duration field optional (defaults to permanent).

- Fixed building the 005 numerics for users in removed connect classes.

- Fixed finding the config file on portable installations (i.e. Windows).

- Fixed removing regular bans that look like an extban.

- Fixed TLS fingerprint fallback in SASL when using Atheme.
