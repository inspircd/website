We have decided to migrate our IRC channels to Teranova. To connect to this network you should update your client to connect to [irc.teranova.net on port +6697](ircs://irc.teranova.net/) (TLS connections only).

We have made the difficult decision to migrate as ChatSpike's TLS certificate has unfortunately expired and I have been unable to reach anyone with access to fix it. Teranova have been an InspIRCd user for many years and may already be familiar to you as the home of [Anope](https://www.anope.org/) of which I am also a maintainer so it feels like a natural place for InspIRCd to move to.

I'd like to thank the ChatSpike team, especially Brain and Duck, for their many years of hosting the InspIRCd IRC channels.
