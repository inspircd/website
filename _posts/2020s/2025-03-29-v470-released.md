InspIRCd v4.7.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/tag/v4.7.0).

The most notable changes in this release are:

- [Fixed a **crash** when a server operator with a custom connect class quits.](https://docs.inspircd.org/security/2025-01)

- Added support for help channels in which users with user mode `h` (helpop) will be automatically granted a channel prefix mode.

- Added the `SAFERATE` 005 token to allow modern clients (e.g. Soju) to know when fakelag is enabled and relax their internal message buffering.

- Changed various messages to use long duration strings (e.g. "1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes") instead of short duration strings (e.g. 1d2h3m).

- Improved the performance of formatting various messages.
