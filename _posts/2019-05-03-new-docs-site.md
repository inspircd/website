InspIRCd's documentation has a new home!

We're retiring our old wiki in favour of a new GitHub-based docs site at [docs.inspircd.org](https://docs.inspircd.org).

All documentation has been rewritten from scratch and should be more complete and reliable than the old wiki. Documentation for the upcoming v3.0.0 release has also been added.

If something is missing from the new site then please request for it to be added [on IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.inspircd.org:+6697/#inspircd) or [file an issue on our new docs issue tracker](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd-docs/issues).
