InspIRCd v3.3.0 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).

This release fixes a crash bug in the mysql module as well as adding several minor features. Most notably:

- Fixed a **crash** in the MySQL module when built against mariadb-connector-c v3.0.5 or newer.
- Changed the maximum value for `<chanfilter:maxlen>` from 100 to 250.
- Fixed listener sockets with `<bind:replace>` enabled not being replaced in some circumstances.
- Fixed not applying IRCv3 `server-time` timestamps on the server the source is connecting from.
- Fixed the `geo_maxmind` module trying to interpret an `AF_UNIX` endpoint as an IP address.

No breaking configuration changes have been made since the v3.0.0 release but if you are upgrading from v2 please consult our [list of config changes in v3](https://docs.inspircd.org/3/breaking-changes).
