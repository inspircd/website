InspIRCd v2.0.20 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).


This release fixes an issue with STARTTLS handling which can potentially cause a crash. Only servers using m_ssl_gnutls with STARTTLS enabled are affected, m_ssl_openssl is unaffected. To mitigate this problem, disable STARTTLS by setting `<gnutls starttls="off">`.

Moreover, an option was added to the m_restrictmsg module to allow sending messages to users on ulined servers, which is useful if m_restrictmsg is used with services.
